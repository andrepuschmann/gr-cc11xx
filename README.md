gr-cc11xx
=========

This GNU Radio out of tree module aims at providing a fully functional
software implementation of the popular TI CC11xx series of low power
RF transceiver chips used in a wide range of devices.

The current implementation only includes:
- 2-FSK receiver
- Frame decoder with CRC and whitening

It has been developed and tested with a Terratec RTL-SDR dongle and
a Nuand bladeRF.
